    "Cut pork into 1/2 cubes and place into a resealable plastic bag. Place remaining ingredients in a blender and blend until evenly mixed. Pour mixture over pork and gently toss to coat, making sure all pieces have the marinade on them. Place in refrigerator to marinate for at least 30 minutes. For best flavor, marinate 2 hours to overnight.",
    "Thread pork on skewers and grill over hot coals for eight to 10 minutes, turning occasionally until done. If using bamboo skewers, soak them in water for one hour to prevent burning.",
    "Combine dipping sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Taste for salt and spice content and adjust to your liking. Serve with fresh of the grilled pork."
