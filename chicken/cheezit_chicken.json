    "Place the Cheez-it’s in a zip-lock baggie and give it to your kid to play catch, touch football, whatever. Smack the back a few times with a rolling pin… get the cheese-it’s crushed, but don’t worry if there are some larger pieces. Pour into a shallow bowl or plate",
    "Crack the eggs into a bowl and add the water. Whisk together until combined well. (something else your child can do!)",

    "Place on the cookie sheet, continue until all the chicken is coated.",
    "Lightly spray all coated chicken with the cooking spray.",
    "Bake at 350°F about 15 -20 minutes (start checking the smaller ones after 10 minutes. I always pull them out as they get cooked through so that the smallest isn’t incinerated by the time the largest piece is done cooking)."
