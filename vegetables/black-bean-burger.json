    "Rinse and drain the black beans. Place in a large mixing bowl and blend with a hand blender. Alternatively, crush the beans with a fork/masher.",
    "Dice the red onion and sundried tomatoes and add to the bowl.",
    "Next, add the oats, eggs, salt, cumin, paprika, olive oil. Give it a good stir.",
    "Finally, add the breadcrumbs a little at a time until you’re left with a nice, firm mixture. If you don’t need to use all the breadcrumbs, that’s totally fine.",
    "Mould the mixture into burger patties. Wet your hands if it's too sticky.",
    "Fry in a little oil in a pan, or place on a BBQ/grill. Cook for about 5 minutes on each side, turning occasionally. Serve with your favourite burger ingredients - a bun, lettuce, tomato, cheese - whatever you fancy!"
